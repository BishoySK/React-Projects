# React Small Projects - Learning with Jonas Schmedtman
Welcome to this repository where I've documented and implemented small React projects as part of my learning journey with Jonas Schmetman's tutorials. Each project within this collection serves as a hands-on exercise, allowing me to apply and reinforce the concepts covered in the course.

How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project folders individually to explore the code for each project.
Feel free to use, modify, or enhance these projects as part of your own learning journey. I encourage you to experiment, tweak the code, and build upon these projects to solidify your understanding of React.
